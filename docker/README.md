# CharlesBOT

![CharlesBOT][2]

CharlesBOT is a Python bot written to take advantage of Slack's [Real Time
Messaging][1] API. It is very much in development at the moment so bear with me
and it'll get there eventually :)

Keep in mind that this Docker image will contain the newest version of
CharlesBOT that is currently available at [PyPI][4].
